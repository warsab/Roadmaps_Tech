Here are some developer roadmaps I've compiled from the fantastic website https://roadmap.sh/. Be sure to check out their GitHub link as well: https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap. These roadmaps, articles, resources, and journeys are crafted by the community to assist you in selecting your career path and advancing in your field.

Each roadmap is tailored to specific roles, outlining the essential skills necessary for each position. Additionally, there are skill-based roadmaps detailing the key items to learn for various skills.
